# Keli language

## Motivation

The following is an excerpt from [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Why-isnt-functional-programming-that-popular-even-though-its-so-beneficial): 

> The user experiences of functional programming languages sucks. 

Keli language aims to create a FP language that has good user experience. 

But, what kind of languages have nice UX? I would say Smalltalk, it is the languages that revolutionarize how we code with the following features:

- Code completion
- Intellisense

But sadly, most FP languages (for example Haskell) has very poor IDE support, firstly I think this is due to the syntax of Haskell itself. Consider language like Smalltalk and Java, it is easy to implement Intellisense for them due to the **dot notation**. 

Thus, Keli language can be seen as an attempt to combine Haskell with Smalltalk.
